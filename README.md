# CENSO
CENSO is a framework for global optimization of nonconvex, possibly spline-constrained, MINLP problems.

CENSO uses the SPLINTER library to compute with splines and other approximations.

NOTE: The code examples in the user guide (Docs/UserGuide/manual.pdf) are currently outdated. Refer to the test problems (TestProblems/*) for examples on how to create and solve optimization problems.
